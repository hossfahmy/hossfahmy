Hi there 👋 
I am exploring opportunities in the Data Science, Machine Learning & AI universe 🌌

Background:

- Master's Degree in Data Science from Lucerne University (Switzerland)
- Master's Degree in Structural Engineering from Kansas State University (USA)
- Bachelor's Degree in Architectural Engineering from Kansas State University (USA)

Thesis Collaboration with VSL International: 🔭 Implementing Data Science in Construction Safety Management as my thesis topic. I have created Machine learning algorithims to predict accidents on site ⚠️👷‍♂️.

I have done several fun and creative projects:

- Data Base Management -> Restaurant Reviews in the USA 🍴
- Web Scraping (Collection, Integration & Preprocessing) -> Crypto Trend Analyzer 💰📈
- Data Visualization (Tableau) -> Tourism in Switzerland 🕴🌍
- Exploratory Data Analysis -> Australian Wildfires 🔥
- Machine Learning -> ML in Speed Dating 💏
- Machine Learning -> ML in Heart Disease 💔
- Deep Learning -> Recycling waste ♻️
- Deep Learning -> Identification of Spam Messages ✉️🚫
- Deep Learning -> Classification of Cats & Dogs 😸🐶
